# SimpleRecipeApp
This App was created for a surprise coding challenge I got after we had finished our main project at the Generation Australia Bootcamp - JWD Cohort - 5.
The technologies used here were HTML, CSS and JavaScript(Vanilla). The editor used was VScode. 
The wireframe was created on draw.io.
The requirements for this coding challenge were,
  - An App that allows addition of recipes with name and ingredients
  - The App should be able to show a list of all recipes
  - It should be possible to delete recipes.
  - Recipes are saved in the browser's local storage.
  - The code should be readable and easy to modify
 
 The App has three main files index.html, index.js, recipe.css.
 The index.js JavaScript file has a class and other essential standalone functions.
